"""Fetch LeBron James shot chart data for a selected NBA season.

This script uses the nba_api ShotChartDetail endpoint to pull all field goal
attempts for LeBron James in a specific season and writes the results to a CSV
mirroring the columns used by the existing shot chart visuals in this project.

The output CSV can be plugged directly into a Vega-Lite shot scatter spec like
`js/shot_scatter_joint.vg.json` by updating the data URL to point at the new
file.
